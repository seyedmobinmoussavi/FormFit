# FormFit
//The research project presents the development of an integrated design to the production method of high-performative curved elements through digital detailing. The methodology both simplifies the production process of complex geometry and enables full integration of the facade functions. The construction system constitutes a paradigm shift in the manufacturing process toward laser cutting flat sheets and elastically deforming them and locking them into their final positions using interlocking connections. The inexpensiveness of manufacturing bespoke geometrical parts with unique interlocking connections enables the design of free-form surfaces and the engineering of highly utilized elements. The research follows an integrated computational methodology in which an integral form-finding approach combines the geometric and material characteristics in the deformation process, to inform the design of connection details as well as structural performance.
